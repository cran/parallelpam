Package: parallelpam
----------------

Version 1.1 [2023-02-01]
* Function GetSubdiag rewritten to deal with cases of overflow (too big data). Vignette parallelpam modified accordingly.
* An item about comparison with other PAM implementations added to the end of the vignette.

Version 1.2 [2023-03-01]
* Error in JMatInfo messages (it did not affect functionality)
* Error in reading of csv files with tabs (tsv) corrected
* Supression of file.remove in vignette at all times and replacement by files in temporary R directory
* Correction in the help of some functions.

Version 1.3 [2023-06-20]
* Corrected errors in GetJRow and GetJCOl for symmetric matrices when indices are bigger than 65536
* Added the cosine and weighted-Euclidean distances

Version 1.4 [2023-09-08]
* Added functions to read/write to/from .csv or .tsv file to create jmatrix files
* Added function to filter rows or columns by their names directly from jmatrix files to create a new jmatrix file 
* Added possibility of reading symmetric matrices from .csv or .tsv files

Version 1.4.1 [2023-10-12]
* Read/write to/from .csv or .tsv checked to avoid strange behaviours when .csv has no row and/or column names.

Version 1.4.2 [2024-07-01]
* Added the inclusion of pthread.h in several .cpp files to prevent a compilation failure using LLVM that does not happen with gcc.
  Thanks to Tomas Kalibera for his kind notice.
* Suppressed a line in silhouette.cpp that used a function from the class Rcpp::Language wich internally calls
  funcion SET_TYPEOF which, according to the R sources (see src/include/Rinternals.h) shouldn't be in the API
  and since June, 2023 seems to have been taken by the CRAN maintainers as a failure.

Version 1.4.3 [2024-07-05]
* Change in a header to avoid new warning in C++20 due to the use of template in a constructor.
